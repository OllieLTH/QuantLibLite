# QuantLibOH

QuantLibOH is a **C++ library, put together for myself to learn and practise object-oriented coding in a financial mathematics setting**.  
It implements basic interest rate curves, swaps, European options, the Black–Scholes model, and a finite-difference engines for Greeks.

> ⚠️ This project was purely for learning purposes and should **not** be used in production.

## Future To-Dos

- Add proper error handling throughout the library  
- Improve default behavior when invalid inputs are passed  
- Add input validation for all classes and functions  
- Extend to more complex derivatives and market models
